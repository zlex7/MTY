              Founded by Dr. Gu, MTY Academy started with a group of Mathematically Talented Youth
               taking math courses at the Austin Great Wall Chinese School taught by Dr. Diana
               Gu. The goal of MTY Academy is to serve as a resource for young students to succeed
                in learning mathematics. To serve more students at different grades, Dr. Gu
                started to teach a series of math courses to several classes in the name of MTY
                Education. With the growing number of students and classes, MTY Academy was
                formed to manage the classes.

            <p id="about-p">

              MTY Academy offers enrichment classes to students from 5th grade to high school.
              The classes are designed to help them to excel in academic fields and stay more
              competitive among their peers.
              Students and parents alike have praised the classes for not only helping students
              achieve good grades in their schools, but also becoming fond of subjects. After
              taking classes at MTY Academy, many students have changed their attitude toward
               the subjects. They no longer think the subject (s) is something they are forced
               to deal with but rather an interesting subject to delve into.

              <p>The goal of MTY Academy is to provide an
                environment for youth to excel academically.
                 At MTY Academy, teachers are not assigned to
                 teach a course. Instead, our courses are
                 offered by teachers who are experienced
                 and love to teach the courses. All of our classes
                 are held at
                 7801 North Lamar Blvd
                 Suite F-38
                 Austin, TX 78752.
                 Here's a map of our classroom location
