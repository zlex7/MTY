                		Q: How do I register for a class at MTY Academy?

                	</p>

                	<p class="answer">

                		A: To register for classes, you must first sign in to your account on the mtyacademy.com website. If you have not created an account yet, see how to sign up as a member. If you have not registered for a class before, you will be asked to provide the student’s information. If you are a parent and registering for your children, you must register each child with a separate account. Next, click on the “Register for Classes” tab and select the class you wish to register for. Please check carefully to see whether the class is right for you, and that the prerequisites are met. The registration form is NOT submitted until you click the submit button at the bottom of the page and a confirmation number is displayed. Unless you are taking a continuing class, the submitted registration is subject to approval. The amount of time it takes to gain approval varies depending on each class. If the registration is subject to approval, an email will be sent to you. Once you receive approval, you will be notified in an email. Finally, print the Payment Form and the Release Form, and make the requested payment. Your registration is complete when the requested payment is received and processed by MTY Academy. <br> <br>

						If the class you wish to register for is full, you will have the option of adding yourself to the waiting list. If any seats reopen due to a lack of payment or unfinished registration, people on the waiting list will be added to the class and notified on a first-come-first-serve basis.

                	<p class="answer">

                		A: Payments for a class can be made as soon as registration is approved. You can view your registration status as well as your payment status online. Your registration is complete only after the full payment requested has been received and processed by MTY Academy. Registration that has been approved but where payment has not been received is subject to be removed, especially in the case where there is a waiting list for the class. There will be a processing fee of $15 for payments made after class starts.
